# Vision Engine Default Configuration
# Phase 2 - PE/PU Surface Defect Detection

# This configuration file should be tuned based on:
# - Actual defect samples from production
# - Target false positive/negative rates
# - QC standards and acceptance criteria

# Anomaly Detection
anomaly_threshold: 0.5  # 0.0 (all pass) to 1.0 (all fail)
enable_anomaly_detector: true

# Rule-Based Detectors
enable_crack_detector: true
enable_hole_detector: true

# Crack Detector Parameters
crack_min_length: 20      # Minimum crack length in pixels
crack_max_width: 5        # Maximum crack width in pixels
crack_confidence_threshold: 0.7  # Minimum confidence to report

# Hole Detector Parameters
hole_min_area: 50         # Minimum hole area in square pixels
hole_max_area: 5000       # Maximum hole area in square pixels
hole_circularity_threshold: 0.6  # 0.0 to 1.0, higher = more circular

# Image Preprocessing
# Set to null to use original image size
resize_width: null
resize_height: null

# Performance
use_gpu: false  # Phase 2 is CPU-only

# Tuning Guide:
#
# For crack detection:
# - Increase crack_min_length if too many false positives on texture
# - Decrease crack_confidence_threshold to catch more subtle cracks
# - Adjust crack_max_width based on actual crack widths in production
#
# For hole detection:
# - Adjust hole_min_area / hole_max_area based on defect size standards
# - Increase hole_circularity_threshold for more circular holes only
# - Decrease threshold to catch irregular voids
#
# For anomaly detection:
# - Increase anomaly_threshold to reduce false positives
# - Decrease threshold for more sensitive detection
# - Requires proper training on OK samples
#
# Validation process:
# 1. Collect 50+ labeled samples (OK and NG with defect types)
# 2. Test with current config
# 3. Measure false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR)
# 4. Adjust thresholds to meet QC requirements
# 5. Document changes and re-validate
